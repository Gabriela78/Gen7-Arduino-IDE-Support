# Gen7-Arduino-IDE-Support v2.2
**RepRap Arduino IDE Support for Arduino 1.6ish**

This is a simple rearrangement of files from https://github.com/Traumflug/Generation_7_Electronics, together with a minor rewrite of the file `boards.txt`, to facilitate compatibility with recent versions of the Arduino IDE. It has undergone limited testing with Arduino 1.6.7; notes of your experiences with other versions from 1.5 onwards, either here or on the [RepRap wiki](http://reprap.org/wiki/Gen7_Arduino_IDE_Support) would be welcomed.

I apologise that this has been set up as a new GitHub repository for distribution, but I am new to GitHub and couldn't figure out the manner in which it could be derived from the original repository. As noted above, the file modifications are minimal, and I would welcome their adoption into the 'official' repository, in which case this one can be removed. No additional attribution required.
